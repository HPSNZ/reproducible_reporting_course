`{ggplot2}` is based on a **layered grammar of graphics**, "a coherent system for describing and building graphs" [(Grolemund & Wickham, 2017)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#introduction-1).

<br />

The grammar of graphics defines a logic for what makes up a plot and how data is mapped to aesthetic features.

## Tidy data and {ggplot2}

`{ggplot2}` works best with **tidy data** that is in **long format**.

--

Data is tidy when:

- Columns are variables,
- Rows are observations, and
- Every row is at a consistent level of observation.

--

Data is long when factor levels are stored within a column, and observation values are stored in a separate column [(Harrison & Pius, 2020)](https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/reshaping-data-long-vs-wide-format.html).

--

The Week 7 materials focus on **how to tidy data**. We'll build on these data tidying skills next week, when we'll look at how to **create plots that are commonly used in Knowledge Edge / NZAJ reports**.

## Common data tidying tasks

- Renaming variables

--

- Defining data classes

--

- Creating subsets by selecting specific variables

--

- Creating subsets by filtering observations

--

- Calculating summary statistics

--

- Creating new variables

--

- Reshaping data (e.g., from wide to long format)

---

## Before we proceed...

If you want to code along as you work through the slides, open the .Rproj file from within the local folder for your course project repo.

--

You'll also need to have installed these packages: `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`, `{janitor}`, `{stringr}`.

--

**Do you remember how to install packages in R?** Give it a go on your own! If you need help, the code for installing these packages will display on the next slide.

---

## Installing packages

Run the code below, one line at a time, in the R console of your R Studio session.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("janitor")
install.packages("stringr")

```

## Renaming variables

## Renaming variables: Concepts

Based on guidance from [Bryan (2015)](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) and [Wickham (2014)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), there are a few key principles I use when naming variables (and objects!) in R:

- **Machine-readable:** Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, different files with very similar names.

--

- **Human-readable:** Include meaningful information about the file content that human readers can undersatnd.

--

- **In snake case:** Lower case with underscores to separate words within a name.

--

- **As concise as possible:** While meeting the 3 principles above! Shorter names are easier to type.

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Let's import data from SQL into R. What SQL object is imported by this code?

```{r import_vw_audience_p2p, cache = TRUE}

# Load libraries
library(RODBC)

# Establish ODBC connection
con <- odbcConnect(
  "HPSNZ_Datamart",
  uid = Sys.getenv("datamart_user"),
  pwd = Sys.getenv("datamart_pwd"))

# Read data into R
audience_data <- sqlQuery(
  con, "SELECT * FROM [CME_HPSNZ].[survey].[vw_audience_p2p]")

# Close the ODBC connection
odbcClose(con)

```


---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Let's import data from SQL into R. What SQL object is imported by this code?

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(RODBC)

# Establish ODBC connection
con <- odbcConnect(
  "HPSNZ_Datamart",
  uid = Sys.getenv("datamart_user"),
  pwd = Sys.getenv("datamart_pwd"))

# Read data into R
audience_data <- sqlQuery( #<<
  con, "SELECT * FROM [CME_HPSNZ].[survey].[vw_audience_p2p]") #<<

# Close the ODBC connection
odbcClose(con)

```

Data in the SQL object `survey.vw_audience_p2p` is imported into an R object called `audience_data`.

--

Do you recall what info is stored in this SQL object? [If not, click here to check the slides from Week 3!](https://ks.sportnzgroup.org.nz/site/ke/ref/2020_K4T_Reproducible_Reports_Week_03_Content.ppsx?Web=1)

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

We can check the names of variables in a data set by using the `names()` function.

In your console, try:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

names(audience_data)

```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}

names(audience_data)

```

--

Which variable names do not adhere to our key naming principles? (*machine-readable*, *human-readable*, *in snake case*, *as concise as possible*)

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

There are a handful of variables that don't adhere to the naming principles: `Date_of_Birth`, `Gender`, `Email_Address`, `Address_County`. You might also see `title` and `nickname` as ambiguous names.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(dplyr)

audience_data %>%
  select(Date_of_Birth, Gender, Email_Address, Address_County, title, nickname) %>%
  names()

```

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

We'll use two packages to tidy up these variable names:

- The `{dplyr}` package contains a lot of super useful functions for tidying data.

--

- The `{janitor}` package helps to efficiently clean up variable names. The `clean_names()` function modifies variable names so they are *machine-readable* and *in snake case*.

--

.pull-left[
```{r clean_names_vw_audience_p2p, message = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(dplyr)
library(janitor)

# Clean up variable names using clean_names()
audience_data %>% #<<
  clean_names() -> audience_data_tidy #<<

```

Let's take a closer look at the highlighted code!
]

.pull-right[
```{r, out.width = "85%", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/janitor_clean_names.png")

```
]

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

```{r new_tidy_things, include = FALSE}

audience_data %>%
  clean_names() -> audience_data_tidy

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

decorate("new_tidy_things") %>%
  flair("%>%") %>%
  flair("->")

```

The code above introduces two new symbols:

--

- `%>%`: This is a pipe operator, which comes from the `{dplyr}` package. In plain language, you can think of the pipe to mean *"and then"*.

--

- `->`: Right assignment. Takes everything to the left of the `->` and stores it in the object named to the right of the `->`.

--

We could describe the logic of this code as follows:

> Call the object named `audience_data`, and then  
> clean up the variable names (with `clean_names()`)  
> and assign the tidied data set to a new object called `audience_data_tidy`.

---

## Side note: Keeping raw and tidy data separate

Notice that the code right-assigns the modified data frame to a new object called `audience_data_tidy`. **Why is this important?**

```{r separate_raw_and_tidy, include = FALSE}

audience_data %>%
  clean_names() -> audience_data_tidy

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

decorate("separate_raw_and_tidy") %>%
  flair("audience_data_tidy")

```

--

It is good practice to **never overwrite the raw data**. This is a cornerstone of reproducible research: other people should be able to use the same raw data and apply the same computational steps to reach the same outcome that you achieve.

--

If new work is saved over a raw data set, it becomes much harder to find and fix mistakes in the data that may have been introduced by some step(s) in the code.

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Let's rename `title` to `survey_title`, and `nickname` to `survey_nickname` so that both variables are clearer to the human reader. We can build on the code we've already started.

--

.pull-left[
```{r rename_vw_audience_p2p}

audience_data %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename( #<<
    survey_title = title, #<<
    survey_nickname = nickname #<<
    ) -> audience_data_tidy

```
]

--

.pull-right[
After the `clean_names()` function, we add another `%>%` pipe operator. This allows us to "add" the `rename()` function, from the `{dplyr}` package, into our data tidying pipeline.
]

--

Inside the `rename()` function, we list the variables we want to rename, in the form of `new_variable_name = original_variable_name`. Use commas when renaming 2 or more variables.

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Now, the logic of the code reads:

```{r eval = FALSE}

audience_data %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    survey_title = title,
    survey_nickname = nickname
    ) -> audience_data_tidy

```

--

> Call the object named `audience_data`, and then  
> clean up the variable names (with `clean_names()`), and then  
> rename `title` to `survey_title` and `nickname` to `survey_nickname`,  
> and assign the tidied data set to an object called `audience_data_tidy`.

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Let's check the variable names of the tidied data object `audience_data_tidy`:

```{r eval = FALSE}

names(audience_data_tidy)

```

--

```{r echo = FALSE}

names(audience_data_tidy)

```

Ta da! Now all the variable names are *machine-readable*, *human-readable*, *in snake case*, and *as concise as possible*.

## Defining data classes: Concepts

When working with data in R that has been imported from the Learning datamart, you will most commonly encounter the following classes of data:

- **Character:** Character strings (e.g., some text).

--

- **Numeric:** Numbers, either whole numbers or decimals.

--

- **Integer:** Whole numbers.

--

- **Logical:** A binary class with two possible values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

--

- **Factor:** Categorical data; can be nominal (no particular order) or ordinal (ordered).

---

## Defining data classes: Concepts

.pull-left[
Why does it matter that data is correctly classified? We want to analyse the data we work with; in Knowledge Edge work, a few common analytical tasks include:

- Counting things
- Calculating summary statistics (e.g., median, interquartile range, mean, standard deviation)
- Analysing data in sub-groups (i.e., in categories)
]

--

.pull-right[
Let's look at an example by revisiting the `ToothGrowth` data set:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

library(kableExtra)

ToothGrowth %>%
  kbl() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "300px", height = "300px")

```
]

---

## Defining data classes: Example

We can use the `str()` function to check the structure of the `ToothGrowth` data set:

```{r}

str(ToothGrowth)

```

--

- The variable `len` is numeric (`num`),
- The variable `supp` is a factor (`Factor`), and
- The variable `dose` is numeric (`num`).

---

## Defining data classes: Example

We can also check the data class of specific variables in a data frame, like so:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Try these out, one at a time, in your R console
class(ToothGrowth$len)
class(ToothGrowth$supp)
class(ToothGrowth$dose)

```

To check the class of a particular variable in a dataframe, we use the `class()` function with the argument within taking the form of `data_frame_object$variable_name`.

---

## Defining data classes: Example

What happens if we try to `sum()` of values in the variable `len` (from the `ToothGrowth` data set)?

```{r}

sum(ToothGrowth$len)

```

The sum total of tooth growth was about `r round(sum(ToothGrowth$len), 0)` mm. Neat!

---

## Defining data classes: Example

Now let's try to sum the values in the variable `supp`:

```{r eval = FALSE}

sum(ToothGrowth$supp)

```

--

**Uh oh!** We get an error that tells us:

`Error in Summary.factor(c(2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, 2L, : âsumâ not meaningful for factors`

We can't calculate the sum of the values in `supp`, because `supp` is a factor variable. That is, it contains information about categories. (In this case, `supp` is a factor with 2 levels that represent supplement types: `OJ` for orange juice and `VC` for vitamin C supplements.)

--

In short: It's not possible to calculate the sum of categories!

---

## Defining data classes: Example

What if we change one of the `numeric` variables into a different data class, say a `character` variable?

--

We could do this by using the base R function `as.character()`. The code below is attempting to calculate the `sum()` of values in `len`, treating `len` as a `character` data class.

```{r eval = FALSE}

sum(as.character(ToothGrowth$len))

```

--

We get another error, because the values inside `len` are not being interpreted as numbers:

`Error in sum(as.character(ToothGrowth$len)) :`  
`  invalid 'type' (character) of argument`

--

This shows us that:

- We can explicitly specify the data class for a variable, and
- Doing so can change what functions can and can't be applied to the re-classified variable.

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Let's work with some data from the Learning datamart:

```{r import_vw_survey_p2p, cache = TRUE}

# Load libraries
library(RODBC)

# Establish ODBC connection
con <- odbcConnect(
  "HPSNZ_Datamart",
  uid = Sys.getenv("datamart_user"),
  pwd = Sys.getenv("datamart_pwd"))

# Read data into R
days_per_week_data <- sqlQuery(
  con, "SELECT * FROM [CME_HPSNZ].[report].[vw_survey_p2p] WHERE question_text LIKE '%Days per week in%'")

# Close the ODBC connection
odbcClose(con)

```

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Use `View(days_per_week_data)` to visually inspect the imported data. Alternatively, scroll through the table below, which displays all values in the variables `question_text` and `response_text`.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

days_per_week_data %>%
  select(question_text, response_text) %>%
  kbl() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "1000px", height = "350px") 

```

**What do you notice?**
 
---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Let's use the `unique()` function to identify the unique values within the `question_text` variable.

```{r}

unique(days_per_week_data$question_text)

```

--

There are `r length(unique(days_per_week_data$question_text))` unique values in the `question_text` variable. The values are strings of characters.

--

R often makes good guesses when assigning data classes to variables during the data importing process, but it's still important to check!

```{r}

class(days_per_week_data$question_text)

```

--

This confirms that R has defined the `question_text` variable to contain `character` values - great!

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Now let's identify the unique values in the `response_text` variable.

```{r}

unique(days_per_week_data$response_text)

```

--

Most values in `response_text` appear to be numbers, although there is one string value: *"N/A"*.

--

Let's check the data class for `response_text`. **What is your intuition about the data class that R has assigned to `response_text`?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}

class(days_per_week_data$response_text)

```

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

```{r }

class(days_per_week_data$response_text)

```

Currently, R has defined `response_text` as containing `character` values. How can this be true, when there are numbers in this variable?

--

While most of the values are numbers, some values are the string *"N/A"*.

```{r, echo = FALSE}

unique(days_per_week_data$response_text)

```

It's possible for numbers to be expressed as `character` strings (the give-away is that the numbers listed above are encased in double-quotes, e.g., `"2"` instead of `2`). But it's not possible for character strings to be defined as `numeric` or `integer`.

--

Here, where `response_text` contains a mixture of `numeric` and `character` values, R defaults to assigning the more inclusive data class of `character` to this variable.

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

We can use `filter()` from the `{dplyr}` package to exclude the "N/A" from the tidied data set:

```{r days_per_week_filter, include = FALSE}

days_per_week_data %>%
  filter(response_text != "N/A") -> days_per_week_data_tidy

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

decorate("days_per_week_filter") %>%
  flair('filter(response_text != "N/A")')

```

--

The logic of the code above reads:

> Call the object named `days_per_week_data`, and then  
> apply a filter that keeps observations where `response_text` does not equal `"N/A"`  
> and assign the tidied data set to an object named `days_per_week_data_tidy`.

<small>Note: `!=` is a common symbol used in many programming languages that means *"not equal to"*.</small>

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Let's check that the filtering has worked as expected:

```{r}

unique(days_per_week_data_tidy$response_text)

```

--

We've listed the unique values that now exist in `response_text`, within the tidied data set. The list no longer includes *"N/A"*.

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Now let's check the data class of `response_text` now that the *"N/A"* values have been filtered out:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

class(days_per_week_data_tidy$response_text)

```

```{r, echo = FALSE}

class(days_per_week_data_tidy$response_text)

```

The data class is still showing `character`!

--

### Confused?

While we've excluded *"N/A"* values, we haven't explicitly re-defined the data class for `response_text`.

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Let's build on the data tidying code we've started. We use the `mutate()` function from the `{dplyr}` package to modify existing variables or create new ones.

```{r}

days_per_week_data %>%
  filter(response_text != "N/A") %>%
  mutate( #<<
    response_text = as.numeric(response_text) #<<
    ) -> days_per_week_data_tidy

```

--

Inside the `mutate()` function, we list the variables we want to modify or create. In this case, we want to modify the existing variable `response_text`.

--

The `as.numeric()` function from base R assigns the `numeric` data class to the argument specified within the parentheses.

--

`as.numeric(response_text)` takes the existing information in `response_text` and classes its values as `numeric` data.

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

```{r}

days_per_week_data %>%
  filter(response_text != "N/A") %>%
  mutate(
    response_text = as.numeric(response_text)
    ) -> days_per_week_data_tidy

```

The logic of the code chunk above now reads:

> Call the object named `days_per_week_data`, and then  
> apply a filter that keeps observations where `response_text` does not equal `"N/A"`, and then  
> modify the variable `response_text` so that it stores the existing information in `response_text` and is classed as a `numeric` variable,  
> and assign the tidied data set to an object named `days_per_week_data_tidy`.

---

## Defining data classes: In practice

Let's check the data class for `response_text` now. **What result do you expect from running the code below?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}

class(days_per_week_data_tidy$response_text)

```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}

class(days_per_week_data_tidy$response_text)

```

--

As one final check, let's see what we get when we generate a list of unique values in the tidied up `response_text` variable:

```{r}

unique(days_per_week_data_tidy$response_text)

```

Notice how the numbers are displayed - now *without* double quotes because these values are no longer defined as `character` class.

---

## Defining data classes: Useful functions

The appropriate function for assigning a data class to a variable depends on what you're trying to achieve.

- `as.numeric()`
- `as.integer()`
- `as.character()`
- `as.logical()`
- `factor()`

--

The first 4 functions listed above are useful for "converting" the data class of a variable or vector to a new data class.

--

The `factor()` function includes some additional arguments that allow you to precisely define the data structure of a `factor` variable you're working with.

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

Recall that **factors are categories**.

--

Categorical data can be **nominal**; that is, in no particular order - for example:

- Tennis
- Basketball
- Skateboarding
- Archery
- Orienteering

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

Let's list these sports in a [vector](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html) that we can work with as a data object in R.

```{r}

# Create a vector to list some sports
sports <- c("Tennis", "Basketball", "Skateboarding", "Archery", "Orienteering")

# Check the data class of the object we've created
class(sports)

```

Right now, R interprets the `sports` object as containing `character` values.

--

<small>You might be familiar with the terminology of factors from prior statistics training. Here, the factor is `sports` and it contains 5 factor levels.</small>

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

Let's re-classify the object `sports` as a `factor`:

```{r}

# Create a new object that stores the values in sports, defined as factor values
sports_reclassified <- factor(sports)

# Check the data class of the new object we've created
class(sports_reclassified)

```

--

We apply `factor()` to the object `sports` with no further details needed, because the categorical data we're working with here has no particular order.

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

Categorical data can also be **ordinal** (ordered / ranked) - for example:

- Primary school
- Secondary school
- Tertiary study

--

We could order these items in order of a student's typical progression path:

1. Primary school
2. Secondary school
3. Tertiary study

--

We could also order these items from "highest" to "lowest" qualification:

1. Tertiary study
2. Secondary school
3. Primary school

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

Let's list the 3 education stages in a [vector](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html).

```{r}

# Create a vector to list education levels
education <- c("Secondary school", "Primary school", "Tertiary study")

# Check the data class of the object we've created
class(education)

```

R has defined the `education` object as containing `character` values.

--

```{r}

unique(education)

```

When we list the unique values in `education`, we see the education stages in the order that we first specified them when creating the vector.

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

Now let's organise the data in `education` so that it is a `factor` variable. We also want its **factor levels** specified in the order that students typically progress through the 3 stages:

--

```{r}

# Create a new object that stores the values from education,
# defined as an ordered factor.
education_reclassified <- factor(
  education,
  levels = c("Primary school",   #<<
             "Secondary school", #<<
             "Tertiary study"))  #<<

# Check the data class of the new object we've created
class(education_reclassified)

```

--

Success! `r emo::ji("strong")`

But wait! There's more...

---

## Defining data classes: Factors

```{r}

unique(education_reclassified)

```

--

When we check the unique values of `education_reclassified`, R lists the values in the order specified by the `levels` argument of `factor()`.

## Subsetting to selected variables: Concepts

The Learning datamart contains a range of SQL views that help to streamline our data-to-analysis workflows. Often, these SQL views contain many columns - this is intentional and helps make each view useful for conducting multiple types of analyses.

--

When you are in the analysis stage, working with data in a tool like R, it can be helfpul to produce subsets of the data you have imported so that it is easier to navigate.

--

By producing data subsets that include only the information needed for a particular analysis, you can increase the performance speed of your code. A code chunk that takes a few seconds to run may not seem to be a slow process on its own, but when compiling long reports that contain many analytical steps, those seconds can add up quickly!

--

One way to produce data subsets is by reducing a data set down to only the variables you need.

## Subsetting to selected variables: In practice

Let's use the `days_per_week_data` we imported earlier. Here is the code to import the data again:

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(RODBC)

# Establish ODBC connection
con <- odbcConnect(
  "HPSNZ_Datamart",
  uid = Sys.getenv("datamart_user"),
  pwd = Sys.getenv("datamart_pwd"))

# Read data into R
days_per_week_data <- sqlQuery(
  con, "SELECT * FROM [CME_HPSNZ].[report].[vw_survey_p2p] WHERE question_text LIKE '%Days per week in%'")

# Close the ODBC connection
odbcClose(con)

```

---

## Subsetting to selected variables: In practice

```{r}

names(days_per_week_data)

```

## Subsetting to selected variables: In practice

```{r}

days_per_week_data %>%
  select(
    individual, nickname, sport_at_completion, question_text, response_text
    ) -> days_per_week_data_subset

```

```{r}

names(days_per_week_data_subset)

```

```{r}

head(days_per_week_data_subset)

```
