`{ggplot2}` is based on a **layered grammar of graphics**, "a coherent system for describing and building graphs" [(Grolemund & Wickham, 2017)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#introduction-1).

<br />

The grammar of graphics defines a logic for what makes up a plot and how data is mapped to aesthetic features.

## Layered grammar of graphics

As described by [Wickham (2010)](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html), take a set of graphical elements...

<center>
```{r, out.width = "60%", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/lgog_fig1.png")

```
</center>

---

## Layered grammar of graphics

...then layer the elements on top of one another to produce a plot.

<center>
```{r, out.width = "45%", echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("images/lgog_fig2.png")

```
</center>

# How to tidy data

---

## Tidy data and {ggplot2}

`{ggplot2}` works best with **tidy data** that is in **long format**.

Data is tidy when:

- Columns are variables,
- Rows are observations, and
- Every row is at a consistent level of observation.

Data is long when factor levels are stored within a column, and observation values are stored in a separate column [(Harrison & Pius, 2020)](https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/reshaping-data-long-vs-wide-format.html).

---

## From *what* to *how*

So far, we've learned about **what** tidy data is. This week, we'll focus on **how** to tidy data.

Some common data tidying tasks include:

- Renaming variables
- Defining data types
- Creating subsets that include only specified variables
- Creating subsets by filtering observations
- Calculating summary statistics
- Creating new variables
- Reshaping data (e.g., from wide to long format)

---

## Before we proceed...

We will use a mix of base R functions and functions from the `{dplyr}` and `{tidyr}`

If you want to code along as you work through the slides, you'll need to install `{janitor}`, `{dplyr}`, `{tidyr}`.

**Do you remember how to install packages in R?** Give it a go on your own! If you need help, the code for installing these packages will display on the next slide.

---

## Installing packages

Run the code below, one line at a time, in the R console of your R Studio session.

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyr")
install.packages("janitor")

```

## Renaming variables: Concepts

Based on guidance from [Bryan (2015)](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files) and [Wickham (2014)](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), key principles I use when naming variables (and objects!) in R:

- **Machine-readable:** Avoid spaces, punctuation, accented characters, different files with very similar names.
- **Human-readable:** Include meaningful information about the file content that human readers can undersatnd.
- **In snake case:** Lower case with underscores to separate words within a name.
- **As concise as possible:** While meeting the 3 principles above! Shorter names are easier to type.

---

## Renaming variables: Example

Let's import data from SQL into R. What SQL object is imported by this code?

```{r import_vw_audience_p2p, cache = TRUE}

# Load libraries
library(RODBC)

# Establish ODBC connection
con <- odbcConnect(
  "HPSNZ_Datamart",
  uid = Sys.getenv("datamart_user"),
  pwd = Sys.getenv("datamart_pwd"))

# Read data into R
audience_data <- sqlQuery(
  con, "SELECT * FROM [CME_HPSNZ].[survey].[vw_audience_p2p]")

# Close the ODBC connection
odbcClose(con)

```


---

## Renaming variables: Example

Let's import data from SQL into R. What SQL object is imported by this code?

```{r eval = FALSE}

# Load libraries
library(RODBC)

# Establish ODBC connection
con <- odbcConnect(
  "HPSNZ_Datamart",
  uid = Sys.getenv("datamart_user"),
  pwd = Sys.getenv("datamart_pwd"))

# Read data into R
audience_data <- sqlQuery( #<<
  con, "SELECT * FROM [CME_HPSNZ].[survey].[vw_audience_p2p]") #<<

# Close the ODBC connection
odbcClose(con)

```

Data in the SQL object `survey.vw_audience_p2p` is imported into an R object called `audience_data`.

--

Do you recall what info is stored in this SQL object? [If not, check the slides from Week 3!](https://ks.sportnzgroup.org.nz/site/ke/ref/2020_K4T_Reproducible_Reports_Week_03_Content.ppsx?Web=1)

---

## Renaming variables: Example

We can check the names of variables in a data set by using the `names()` function.

In your console, try:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

names(audience_data)

```

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}

names(audience_data)

```

--

Which variable names do not adhere to our key naming principles? (*machine-readable*, *human-readable*, *in snake case*, *as concise as possible*)

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

There are a handful of variables that don't adhere to the naming principles: `Date_of_Birth`, `Gender`, `Email_Address`, `Address_County`. You might also see `title` and `nickname` as ambiguous names.

We can use the `{janitor}` package to efficiently clean up variable names. The `clean_names()` function modifies variable names so they are *machine-readable* and *in snake case*.

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

```{r clean_names_vw_audience_p2p, message = FALSE}

# Load the {janitor} library
library(janitor)

# Clean up variable names using clean_names()
audience_data %>% #<<
  clean_names() -> audience_data_tidy #<<

```

The highlighted code above introduces two new symbols:

--

- `%>%`: This is a pipe operator, which comes from the `{dplyr}` package. In plain language, you can think of the pipe to mean *"and then"*.

--

- `->`: Right assignment. Takes everything to the left of the `->` and stores it in the object named to the right of the `->`.

--

Therefore, we can describe the logic of the highlighted code as:

> Call the object called `audience_data`, and then  
> clean up the variable names and assign the data set to a new object called `audience_data_tidy`.

---

## Side note: Keeping raw and tidy data separate

Notice that the code calls the raw data object `audience_data`, applies a function, then stores the modified data in a new object called `audience_data_tidy`. **Why is this important?**

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# Clean up variable names using clean_names()
audience_data %>%
  clean_names() -> audience_data_tidy

```

--

It is good practice to **never overwrite the raw data**. Remember that this is a cornerstone of reproducible research: other people should be able to use the same raw data and apply the same computational steps to reach the same outcome that you achieve.

--

If new work is saved over a raw data set, it is much harder to find and fix mistakes in the data that have been introduced by some part of your code.

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Let's rename `title` to `survey_title`, and `nickname` to `survey_nickname` so that both variables are clearer to the human reader.

Building on the code we've already started:

```{r rename_vw_audience_p2p, message = FALSE}

# Load the {dplyr} library
library(dplyr)

audience_data %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename( #<<
    survey_title = title, #<<
    survey_nickname = nickname #<<
    ) -> audience_data_tidy

```

---

## Renaming variables: In practice

Let's check the variable names of the tidied data object `audience_data_tidy`:

```{r}

names(audience_data_tidy)

```

## Activity X

Start building a plot for your course project.

At minimum, you need to:

- Create a "canvas" for your plot, using the `ggplot()` function
- Inside the `ggplot()` function, specify your data source
- Inside the `ggplot()` function, nest the `aes()` function and define the variables you want to map to the x and y axes
- Add a layer to your plot with an appropriate `geom_*()` for the type of plot you want to create.

You may also need to:

- Tidy your source data so that it is suitable for plotting (e.g., reshaping to long format, creating new variables)
- Merge your source data (from the SQL datamart) with external data (e.g., shapefiles for making map-type plots)
