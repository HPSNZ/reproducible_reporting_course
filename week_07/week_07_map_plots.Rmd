`{ggplot2}` is a powerful, flexible, and widely used R package for making plots.

What makes it so useful is that it is based on a **layered grammar of graphics**, "a coherent system for describing and building graphs" [(Grolemund & Wickham, 2017)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#introduction-1).

The grammar of graphics defines a logic for what makes up a plot and how data is mapped to aesthetic features.

<small>Note: The `gg` in `{ggplot2}` stands for **g**rammar of **g**raphics!</small>

## Layered grammar of graphics

As described by [Wickham (2010)](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.html), take a set of graphical elements...

## Layered grammar of graphics

...then layer the elements on top of one another to produce a plot.

## An analogy: Painting and {ggplot2}

Imagine a simplified process for painting:

--

- You have something to paint on (e.g., a canvas),

--

- You have a rough idea of what you want the finished piece to look like, and

--

- You paint in layers from background to foreground.

<br />

--

When building plots with `{ggplot2}`:

- Your "canvas" is the plotting area and coordinate system,

--

- You have a type of plot in mind (e.g., a bar plot, one colour per group), and

--

- You write code for each plot layer in order, from background to foreground.

# Recap: Tidy data principles

---

## Tidy data and {ggplot2}

`{ggplot2}` is part of the `{tidyverse}` set of packages, so it is designed to work well with other R packages that adhere to tidy data principles.

--

`{ggplot2}` works best with **tidy data** that is in **long format**.

---

## Remind me...what is tidy data?

Data is tidy when:

- Columns are variables,

--

- Rows are observations, and

--

- Every row is at a consistent level of observation.

---

## What is long data?

Data is long when factor levels are stored within a column, and observation values are stored in a separate column [(Harrison & Pius, 2020)](https://argoshare.is.ed.ac.uk/healthyr_book/reshaping-data-long-vs-wide-format.html).

## Activity X

Start building a plot for your course project.

At minimum, you need to:

- Create a "canvas" for your plot, using the `ggplot()` function
- Inside the `ggplot()` function, specify your data source
- Inside the `ggplot()` function, nest the `aes()` function and define the variables you want to map to the x and y axes
- Add a layer to your plot with an appropriate `geom_*()` for the type of plot you want to create.

You may also need to:

- Tidy your source data so that it is suitable for plotting (e.g., reshaping to long format, creating new variables)
- Merge your source data (from the SQL datamart) with external data (e.g., shapefiles for making map-type plots)
